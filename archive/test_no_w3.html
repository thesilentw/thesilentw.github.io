	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm a Technical and World Designer looking to forge a new path at a community-focused studio that values systemic interactions, respect for the player's time, and narrative depth.</p>
	<p>I'm skilled at resolving the often-contradictory demands of open-world games that are rich in both narrative and systemic interaction, and have retained my knack for technical multi-disciplinary problem-solving and bug-crushing from my days in QA.</p>
	<p>I'm always open to interesting, challenging new opportunities where I can expand my skillset and push the envelope!</p>
